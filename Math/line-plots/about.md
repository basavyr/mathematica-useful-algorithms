# Mathematica - plotting energies

This document is aimed at creating data visualization of the excited spectra of different nuclei, by showing the values w.r.t to the angular momentum as horizontal lines.

Having a type of data visualization of this type can really improve the readability of the results (by comparing the theoretical energetic values with the experimental ones).
